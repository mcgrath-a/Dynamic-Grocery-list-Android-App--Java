# Dynamic-Grocery-list-Android-App--Java

Project Description:
I built an expense calculator where you can add/delete an expense, and the expense will be displayed in a scrollable view. If you click on the “Calculate” button, it calculates the total expense and displays it in a second activity

This simple app was created with the goals to:
	Practice activities and passing information using intents between activities;
	Practice how to dynamically create views and adding them to activities;
	Practice how to create scrollable views;
	Practice how to create toasts.
